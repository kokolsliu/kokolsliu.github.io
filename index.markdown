    <div class="statement">
        I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at USC. My research focuses on bridging physics-based modeling and data-driven perception for soft robotic systems.
        I also work in numerical simulation of complex and multiphycis systems, as well as structural optimization of compliant mechanisms. 
        In personal life, I am a portrait photographer, feel free to connect me on soical medias.
